This repository contains three folders, one for each experiment in our paper “Stochastic optimization under time drift: iterate averaging, step decay, and high probability guarantees”; arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07356. 

Each folder contains a .py file containing Python script for the relevant experiment, along with two Jupyter notebooks – one for implementing said experiment and one for gathering the generated plots.
